@import "type-theme";
```

`@import "type-theme";` is including the theme styles, so you can add custom imports before and after it, depending on your needs.
Best practice is to put your custom files in the `_sass` folder of your progect.
Jekyll will automatically look for them there.
For example, say you wanted to override some theme variables and add some custom styles, you can create the following files:

``` scss
// _sass/_variables.scss
$background-color: black;
```

``` sass
// _sass/_custom.sass

// SASS is supported as well, just note the file extension is .sass
.feature-image header
  height: 300px
```

Then import them both into `main.scss`:

``` scss
// assets/css/main.scss
---
---

@import "variables";
@import "type-theme";
@import "custom";
```

## Posts and pages in Type Theme

Please refer to the [Jekyll docs for writing posts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/).
Non-standard features are documented below.

### Math typesetting

Wrap math expressions with `$$` signs in your posts and make sure you have set the `katex` variable in `_config.yml` to `true` for math typesetting.

For inline math typesetting, type your math expression on the *same line* as your content.
For example:

``` latex
Type math within a sentence $$2x^2 + x + c$$ to display inline
```

For display math typesetting, type your math expression on a *new line*.
For example:

``` latex
$$
  \bar{y} = {1 \over n} \sum_{i = 1}^{n}y_i
$$
```

Type Theme makes use for [KaTeX](https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/) for typesetting.

### Feature images

![Posts with geometric feature images](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/816965/5142406/19726478-71d6-11e4-8111-94f788b0e44d.png)

Add a feature image by specifying a path to an image in the [front matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) in the form of `feature-img: "assets/img/PATH_TO_IMAGE.png"`.

For example:

``` yml
---
title: 'Hello World'
feature-img: "assets/img/sample_feature_img.png"
---
```

By default, the page title is displayed on top of the feature image, as well as on the browser's tab.
You can change the feature image's displayed title by specifying a `feature-title` in the front matter:

``` yml
---
title: 'Short title'
feature-title: A much longer title
feature-img: "assets/img/sample_feature_img.png"
---
```

### Hiding pages from navigation

In the front matter of a page, add `hide: true` to prevent the page from showing up in the header's navigation bar (visitors can still visit the URL through other means).

For example:

``` yml
---
title: 'Error 404: Page not found'
permalink: /404.html
hide: true
---
```

### Sorting pages in navigation

You can configure this theme to **sort your pages** in the header's navigation bar.

-   Set `site_navigation_sort` in theme settings to a property name e.g. `'order'`
-   In the front matter of a non-hidden page, add `order: n`

For example:

``` yml
---
title: 'Team'
permalink: /team/
order: 4
---
```

### Tags

Post tags should be placed between `[]` in your post metadata.
Separate each tag with a comma.

For example:

``` yml
---
title: 'Markdown and HTML'
categories: [sample, markdown, html]
---
```

A tags listing will be automatically generated using the `tags.html` file provided in Type Theme.
If you're not using the tags feature it is safe to delete `tags.html`.

### Search

The search feature can be activated in the `_config.yml` file by changing its value from `false` to `true`.

``` yml
  #Scripts
  search: true
```

Once activated, the search bar will appear in the header.
This feature uses [Lunr](https://lunrjs.com/) and searches through the title, tags and content of your posts.

### Subtitles

A subtitle can be displayed below your title on permalink post pages.

To enable this feature, add `subtitle` to your post metadata.

For example:

``` yml
---
title: "This is a title"
subtitle: "This is a subtitle"
comments: false
---

``` scss
// assets/css/main.scss
---
---

@import "variables";
@import "type-theme";
@import "custom";
```
