> v1.1.0 is now available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=SpaDES)!

`SpaDES` (Spatial Discrete Event Simulation) is a generic simulation platform that can be used to create new model components quickly.
It's' easy to implement a variety of simulation models including raster-based, event-based, and agent-based models.

The latest version of `SpaDES` introduces several new features and fixes a number of issues from the previous 1.0.1 release, including:

* require R version 3.2.2 or higher;
* enhanced metadata specification for modules;
* improved template for creating new modules;
* enhancements to the module repository, with the new `downloadModule()` and `downloadData()` functions;
* add 'priority' to events to help resolve ties for events sheduled at the same time;
* add unit tests and coverage to `newModule()`;
* improve dependency graph & module diagram;
* improved documentation and vignettes;

For a complete list of changes, see [the package's NEWS file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PredictiveEcology/SpaDES/master/NEWS).

Please note that due to the number and scope of the enhancements, modules previously developed using the previous version may not work.
