> v1.1.3 is now available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=SpaDES)!

This release fixes a number of bugs that had crept through last week's 1.1.2 release.

The main additions are:

* bug fix in `experiment` that did not allow parallel spawning on some systems and crashed with empty `outputs` argument
* fix minor bugs in `sampleModules`
* lots of documentation enhancements, esp. `?inputs` and `?outputs`
* add `.plotInitialTime` and `.saveInitialTime` arguments to `spades()` to easily allow turning off plotting and saving

For a complete list of changes, see [the package's NEWS file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PredictiveEcology/SpaDES/master/NEWS).
