> v1.3.1 is now available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=SpaDES).

This is a fairly significant update, with several important enhancements and bug fixes.

* The default locations for simulation inputs, outputs, cache, and module paths have changed and can be easily set via new option `spades.inputPath`, `spades.outputPath`, `spades.cachePath`, and `spades.modulePath`, respectively.
* The `spades.modulesRepo` option was renamed to `spades.moduleRepo`.
* Improved simulation debugging: the `debug` argument in `spades` can now accept any expression as a character string, and `debug = TRUE` only prints the current event (the old behaviour can be restored using `debug = "simList"`)
* Improved useability for module developers, including:

    - New RStudio addin to simplify creation of new modules;
    - Modules with lots of code can be split into several files: put helper functions etc. into `.R` files located in the module's `R/` subdirectory;

* New tools for performing heuristic optimization using pattern orientated modelling (see `?POM`)
* Improved support of parallel computatations
