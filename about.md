### Predictive Ecology Lab Group

We are located in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, at the Pacific Forestry Centre. Several lab members are students through Université Laval and are based out of Québec City.

My research interests lie in applied ecology, conservation and forecasting of a broad array of ecosystems and species. Specifically, I am interested in using modern quantitative techniques to understand the natural complexity of ecosystems, and ultimately, to allow forecasting of organisms and ecosystem processes. I use a variety of quantitative techniques, including Hierarchical Bayes, Spatial Analysis, Landscape Simulation Modeling, Structural Equation Modeling, and Non-Linear Models to achieve the best ecological inference from ecological data. Through each of the systems I study, I strive to understand the ecological processes and to test this understanding by forecasting.

</div>

[Yong Luo](https://sites.google.com/a/lakeheadu.ca/yong-luo/home) is working on forest succession modeling.  

*Research interests*  
  1. How the tree mortality is governed by endogenous factors, such as competition, aging, and species interaction.  
  2. How the tree mortality affected by recent climate changes such as regional warming and drought.  
  3. The consequences of mortality in terms of forest carbon sequestration.
