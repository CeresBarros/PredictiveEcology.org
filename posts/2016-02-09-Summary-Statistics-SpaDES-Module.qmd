Often, we want to calculate some summary statistics from an object, such as a the mean value of a map, and plot that as a graph, updated at some interval, so that we can see how that statistic behaves over the simulation.

What's the best way to do this in a [SpaDES](https://spades.predictiveecology.org/) simulation?
