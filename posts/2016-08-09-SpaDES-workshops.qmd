**Updated September 9, 2016**

Alex Chubaty and I will be leading two [introductory SpaDES workshops](https://rpubs.com/PredictiveEcology/SpaDES-Intro-Course-Outline) this fall.
They will essentially be the same course, but one will be mid September, and the second will be in early December. 
We will be doing two workshops because there is immediate need for some users, but there are major travel restrictions for other users given the time frame.

### Dates: 

- Workshop 1 - Sept 14-16, 2016
- Workshop 2 - Dec 7-9, 2016 (tentative)

#### Both workshops:

**Cost: Free**

**Where: Pacific Forestry Centre, Victoria, BC**
