[`SpaDES`](https://spades.predictiveecology.org/) simulations typically start and end at a pre-specified times.
So how do you end a simulation based on some other stopping criteria, such as when some variable reaches a particular value?

See my post on the [`SpaDES` FAQ](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/SpaDES/wiki/Conditional-end-simulation).
