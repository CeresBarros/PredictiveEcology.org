Apologies to anyone trying to install `reproducible`, `NetLogoR`, and any `SpaDES` packages from CRAN.
We had one of our dependencies (`reproducible`) temporarily archived, but we are in the process of submitting a fixed version, which should restore the other packages.

In the meantime, installing the GitHub versions of `reproducible`, followed by any other packages should get you back to a working version.

```r
remotes::install_github("PredictiveEcology/reproducible")
remotes::install_github("PredictiveEcology/SpaDES.core")
```
