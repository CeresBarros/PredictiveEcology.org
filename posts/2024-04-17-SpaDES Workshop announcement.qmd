Survey sent out for planning for SpaDES Workshop.

Dr. Ceres Barros and I will be leading a 2-3 day workshop on training with SpaDES.

Before we make final arrangements, we ask to fill out the linked form to help with planning:
[https://predictiveecology.org/workshops/June-2024-SpaDES-workshop.html](https://predictiveecology.org/workshops/June-2024-SpaDES-workshop.html)

Primarily we are asking for:

- an email address to send subsequent emails only the individuals who are interested;
- whether you can do *In Person* or *Virtual*, and
- preferred workshop objectives.

Thank you,

Eliot and Ceres
