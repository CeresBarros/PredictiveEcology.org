# R packages

## `fpCompare`

### Reliable Comparison of Floating Point Numbers

Comparisons of floating point numbers are problematic due to errors associated with the binary representation of decimal numbers. Despite being aware of these problems, people still use numerical methods that fail to account for these and other rounding errors (this pitfall is the first to be highlighted in Circle 1 of Burns (2012) [The R Inferno](http://www.burns-stat.com/pages/Tutor/R_inferno.pdf)). This package provides four new relational operators useful for performing floating point number comparisons with a set tolerance.

## `SpaDES`

### Develop and Run Spatially Explicit Discrete Event Simulation Models

Easily implement a variety of simulation models, with a focus on spatially explicit agent based models. The core simulation components are built upon a discrete event simulation framework that facilitates modularity, and easily enables the user to include additional functionality by running user-built simulation modules. Included are numerous tools to visualize raster and other maps.
